    For this mission, you are asked to implement Kruskal algorithm in order to compute the minimum spanning tree corresponding to an input file. As a reminder, we impose one implementation detail (which won't be checked on INGInious, but manually by the tutors) :

    - You have to use a Union/Find structure to handle the clusters (this doesn't change from the pseudo-code of the book).

    Concretely, you have to write one program : *Kruskal.java*, which reads the file located at argv[0] and writes the result in a new file located at argv[1]. The output format must be the same as for the input.

    Additional informations :

    - The input file format is valid.

    - The graph represented by the input file is connected.

    - All edges have a cost strictly greater than 0 (which means the number of edges will always be the number of nodes minus 1).

    - There can not be 2 edges with same end vertices.

    - The cities can be represented by any positive integer (not necessarily consecutive).
