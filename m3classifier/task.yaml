    For this mission, you have to write a spam filter

    You are asked to write a mini-PostScript interpreter as described in the *pdf* of the mission. Precisely, you must implement the following interface :

    .. code-block:: java

        public interface Interpreter {

            @pre: 'instructions' is a valid chain of PostScript instructions
            @post: returns a String representing the state of the stack when a 'pstack' instruction is encountered.
                If several elements are still on the stack, separate them with whitespaces.
                If there is no element on the stack or no 'pstack' instruction, return the empty string ("").
            public String interpret(String instructions);

        }

    Don't forget to throw the different possible exceptions : think about java.util.EmptyStackException, java.lang.ArithmeticException...
