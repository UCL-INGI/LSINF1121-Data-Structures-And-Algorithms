    For this mission, you have to write a spam filter (a class named "SpamFilter") implementing the following interface :

    .. code-block:: java

        public interface SpamFiltering {

            @pre:
            @post:
            public String interpret(String instructions);

        }

    Don't forget to throw the different possible exceptions : think about java.util.EmptyStackException, java.lang.ArithmeticException...
