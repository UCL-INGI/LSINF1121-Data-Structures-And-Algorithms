    Consider a graph made of 10 disjoit nodes (numbered from 0 to 9). We use a union-find data structure to represent this graph. At first, each node is contained in a partition named after the node. Thus, the representation of the graph in the array ``id[]`` is:

    ::

        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

    The following questions will ask you to type the representation of the graph after we use the **quick-find** algorithm to add an edge between 2 nodes. You must type this representation in the same way it was typed above.

    **Note:** When we join ``p-q`` with the quick-find algorithm, the convention is to change ``id[p]`` (and potentially other entries) but not ``id[q]``.
