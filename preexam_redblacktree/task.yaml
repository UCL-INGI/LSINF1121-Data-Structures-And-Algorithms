    Consider an empty ``Red-Black Tree`` in which we progressively add numbers.

    The following questions will ask you to write a representation of the ``Red-Black Tree`` as we add objects in it. Write it as if you were reading from left to right and from top to bottom (ignoring the possible blanks). For example, if your answer is:

    ::

              6
            /   \
         (2 4)   7
         / | \    \
        1  3  5    9

    You would write:

    ::

        6 24 7 1 3 5 9

    Note how the 2-3 node composed of ``2`` and ``4`` is written in a merged way (``24``).
