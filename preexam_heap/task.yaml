    Consider an empty ``Heap`` in which we progressively add numbers.

    The following questions will ask you to write a representation of the ``Heap`` as we add objects in it. You must write the ``Heap`` as if it was stored in an array. For example, if your answer is:

    ::

            9
           / \
          5   8
         / \
        4   3

    You would write:

    ::

        9 5 8 4 3
