    Consider an empty ``Heap`` in which we progressively add numbers.

    The following questions will ask you to write a representation of the heap as we add objects in it. You must write the heap as if it was stored in an array. For example, if your answer is:

    ::

           9
          / \
         5   8
        / \
        4 3

    You would write:

    ::

        9 5 8 4 3
