    ==================================================

    Assume the following 5x5 matrix:

    .. code-block:: java

        int [][] tab = new int[][] {{1,3,3,1,3},
                                  {4,2,2,4,5},
                                  {4,4,1,4,2},
                                  {1,4,2,3,6},
                                  {1,1,1,6,3}};

    represented in the array here under:

    .. image:: globalwarming_unionfind/matrix.png
                    :width: 200px
                    :align: center
                    :alt: matrix example

    Each entry of the matrix represents an altitude.
    The objective is to implement a class `GlobalWarmingImpl` that implements all the methods described in `GlobalWarming` given next.

    A global water level specified in the constructor models the fact that all the positions of the matrix with a value <= the water level are flooded (under the water) and thus unsafe.
    In the above example, the water level is 3, all the safe points are green.

    The methods you must implement are

    * the number of islands
    * a test to verify if two positions are on the same island

    we assume that points are **only connected vertially or horizontally**.

    .. code-block:: java


       import java.util.List;

       abstract class GlobalWarming {

           /**
            * A class to represent the coordinates on the altitude matrix
            */
           public static class Point {

               final int x, y;

               Point(int x, int y) {
                   this.x = x;
                   this.y = y;
               }

               @Override
               public boolean equals(Object obj) {
                   Point p = (Point) obj;
                   return p.x == x && p.y == y;
               }
           }

           final int[][] altitude;
           final int waterLevel;


           /**
            * In the following, we assume that the points are connected to
            * horizontal or vertical neighbors but not to the diagonal ones
            * @param altitude is a n x n matrix of int values representing altitudes (positive or negative)
            * @param waterLevel is the water level, every entry <= waterLevel is flooded
            */
           public GlobalWarming(int[][] altitude, int waterLevel) {
               this.altitude = altitude;
               this.waterLevel = waterLevel;
           }


           /**
            * An island is a connected components of safe points wrt to waterLevel
            * @return the number of islands
            */
           public abstract int nbIslands();

           /**
            *
            * @param p1 a point with valid coordinates on altitude matrix
            * @param p2 a point with valid coordinates on altitude matrix
            * @return true if p1 and p2 are on the same island, that is both p1 and p2 are safe wrt waterLevel
            *        and there exists a path (vertical/horizontal moves) from p1 to p2 using only safe positions
            */
           public abstract boolean onSameIsland(Point p1, Point p2);


       }

            Copy-paste and complete the code below.
            Be careful with the expected time-complexity in each method.
            To meet these time-complexity some precomputation should already be done in the constructor. Don't hesitate to create inner classes in GlobalWarmingImpl to facilitate your implementation.
            Feel free to use any method or data-structure available in the Java language and API.

            .. code-block:: java

               import java.util.*;

               public class GlobalWarmingImpl extends GlobalWarming {

                   public GlobalWarmingImpl(int[][] altitude, int waterLevel) {
                       super(altitude,waterLevel);
