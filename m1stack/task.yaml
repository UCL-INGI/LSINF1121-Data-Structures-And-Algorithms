    You are asked to implement the following interface, representing a stack, without using *java.util.Stack<E>* !

    .. code-block:: java

        public interface Stack<E> {

            public boolean empty();

            public E peek();

            public E pop();

            public E push(E item);

        }

    You are also asked to write unit tests to test both the stack and your PostScript interpreter.
