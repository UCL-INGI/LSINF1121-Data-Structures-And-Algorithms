    You are asked to implement the following interface, representing a stack, using a singly linked list. You should at least have one constructor with no argument, creating an empty stack.

    Note: using *java.util.Stack<E>* is forbidden!

    .. code-block:: java

        import java.util.EmptyStackException;

        public interface Stack<E> {

            public boolean empty();

            public E peek() throws EmptyStackException;

            public E pop() throws EmptyStackException;

            public E push(E item);

        }
