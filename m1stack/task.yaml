    You are asked to implement the following interface, representing a stack, using a singly linked list. You should at least have one constructor with no argument, creating an empty stack.

    Note: using *java.util.Stack<E>* is forbidden!

    .. code-block:: java

        import java.util.EmptyStackException;

        public interface Stack<E> {

            public boolean empty();

            public E peek() throws EmptyStackException;

            public E pop() throws EmptyStackException;

            public E push(E item);

        }

            Upload the file containing your implementation here. The class representing your stack should be named *MyStack* and implement *Stack* (as usual, the interface is available on INGInious).

            **Note:** You should **not** put your class in a java package. In other words, you should **not** use the ``package`` keyword.
