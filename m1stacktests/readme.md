This task was not adapted to the new Inginious Java exercise format. 
The format was defined in july-august 2019 by Bastin J, Yakoub J, Rucquoy A and Piron H as they were working for INGI department at the UCLouvain.
If you want more information about the new format you can find them at https://github.com/UCL-INGI/LEPL1402.
