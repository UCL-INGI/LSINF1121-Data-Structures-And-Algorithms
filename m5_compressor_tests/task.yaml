    For this task, you have to write unit tests using JUnit in order to check several implementations of compressors and decompressors. You are given two classes, *Compress* and *Decompress*, and you have to determine if they do their job correctly or not. We provide you a small template to begin writing your tests :

    .. code-block:: java

        import org.junit.Test;
        import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;
        import static org.junit.Assert.assertTrue;
        import static org.junit.Assert.fail;
        import java.io.PrintWriter;
        import java.util.Scanner;
        import java.io.IOException;
        import java.io.File;

        public class CompressTests {

            @Test
            public void firstTest() {
            try {
                String str = "abcdefg";
                assertEquals(compress_decompress(str), str);
            } catch (Exception e) {
                fail("Exception occured : " + e);
            }
            }

            @Test
            public void secondTest() {
                ...
            }

            public String compress_decompress(String content) throws IOException {
            PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter("./input.txt");
            writer.println(content);
            writer.close();
            Compress.main(new String[]{"./input.txt", "./compressed.txt"});
            Decompress.main(new String[]{"./compressed.txt", "./output.txt"});
            Scanner scanner = new Scanner(new File("./output.txt"));
            String str = scanner.useDelimiter("\\Z").next();
            scanner.close();
            return str;
            }
        }

    NB : you don't know the internal representation of the compressed file, but you can still check some of its properties : for example, a long file with only high-frequency characters should have a pretty good compression rate.
