#! /bin/bash
# BuggySearchTree :
# 1 : !isEmpty()
# 2 : remove doesn't remove anything
# 3 : constructor with String argument does same as no argument constructor
# 4 : constructor with String argument only treats the 2 first lines of the file
# 5 : ceilingEntry and floorEntry are inversed.
# 6 : firstEntry() actually returns the second entry.
# 7 : getOrdered doesn't sort the songs
# 8 : entriesBetween returns entries STRICTLY in the range (should be inclusive)
# 9 : entriesBetween returns entries from 'lowest' (but to the max, not to 'highest')
# 10 : toString format not respected
