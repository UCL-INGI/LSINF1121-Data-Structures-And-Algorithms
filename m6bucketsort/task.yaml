    You are asked to implement the Bucket-Sort algorithm on a specific digit (identified by the second parameter) of an integer number (given as first parameter). Concretely, you have to create a class *BucketSort* with one static method *sort* with the following specifications :

    .. code-block:: java

        /*
         * @pre 'tab' contains only positive integers, 'digit' belongs to [0, 9]
         * @post 'tab' is not modified
         * @returns a new table containing the elements of 'tab' sorted in increasing order
         * on digit 'digit' (digit '0' for the unit, '1' for the decimal and so on).
         * The algorithm must be stable ! (ordering of elements with the same keys is preserved)
             */
        public static int[] sort(int[] tab, int digit);

    Beware that you Bucket-Sort implementation should run in *linear* time !
